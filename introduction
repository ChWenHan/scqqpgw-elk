The simplist way to implement the qp-gw.
1)By analytical continueing the imaginary self-energy , the ΔSEr in real domain is 
firstly hermitinatized and set to be static(by picking the poles at eigvals, different from the 'static' in cohsex method). 
2)Then, the new SEr is added into the DFT hamiltonian. 
3)The diagonalization of the hamiltonian will consequently ggive the new eigenvalues and eigenvecs.
4)The new eigvals and eigvecs are then used to generate new the basis(basically the apw/lo function and Vxc(r) ) of the next DFT iteration.

Should be noticed that, for each sc loop, the previous DFT calculation is required as the ΔSE used
in diagonalization is written as : ΔSE = SE_x+SEi_c - V_xc. Thus the Hamiltonian is :H_ij = ε_ij + ΔSE_ij.


The problem for this code is the bad convergence.
One can probably see that for most cases the calculation is fluctuating around a certain energy range(~0.01Ha-0.001Ha), but never stable.
That may due to the instable AC code in Elk.
